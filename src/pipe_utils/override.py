"""
Imports everything but aliases:
`filer_`, `map_`, `all_`, `any_`, and `slice_` to not include the trailing
underscore â€“ overriding their corresponding builtin names.

And, `not_`, `or_`, `and_`, `is_`, `is_not`, `raise_` to
`Not`, `Or`, `And`, `Is`, `IsNot`, `Raise` to remove the trailing underscore.
CamelCase to avoid clash with keywords.
